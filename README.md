# Pig Game

### Game Rules:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls the dice as many times as they wish. Each result get added to their **ROUND** score
- **If** the player rolls a 1, all of their **ROUND** score gets lost. After that, it's the _next player's turn_.
- The player can choose to **'Hold'**, which means that their **ROUND** score gets added to their **GLOBAL** score. After that, it's the _next player's turn_.
- The first player to reach ~~100 points~~ on the **GLOBAL** score wins the game!
- _**(Optional)**_ You can set your own **Winning Score** by inputting a number into the `Final Score` input box.
